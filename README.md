# starter express app template
## Katherine Taylor, COSC 52, 20S

* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules

Profile set up to run on [heroku](https://lab5-kattaylor22.herokuapp.com/)
* I added a /api at the end for it to work in ROOT_URL in lab 4


## What worked and didn't
I think my functions in post_controller worked very well and pretty quickly were functioning correctly.
I struggled a bit with getting the syntax of my lab 4 that had worked alone to now work with lab 5. But, with not too much effort, I got it all sorted out!
