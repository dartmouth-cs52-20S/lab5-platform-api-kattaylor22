# starter express app template
## Katherine Taylor, COSC 52, 20S

* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules

Profile set up to run on [heroku](https://lab5-kattaylor22.herokuapp.com/)
* I added a /api at the end for it to work in ROOT_URL in lab 4


## What worked and didn't
I think my functions in post_controller worked very well and pretty quickly were functioning correctly.
I struggled a bit with getting the syntax of my lab 4 that had worked alone to now work with lab 5. But, with not too much effort, I got it all sorted out!

# p.2

I added authentication to my notes app! To do this, I made edits both on the back-end and front-end.

### What worked
I ran into a bunch of small issues along the way, but nothing tripped me up for too long. I was surprised and happy with how my setup from lab 4 was not too difficult to transfer, and so that went very well. I did not end up adding in extending the user model to contain username as well unfortuantely because I ran out of time. But, other than that, I am happy with my app!
